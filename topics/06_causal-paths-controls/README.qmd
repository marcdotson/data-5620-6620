- Paths are alternate explanations, ignoring the arrows of causality (*The Effect* p. 116)
- "[E]ach of those paths contains a story" (*The Effect* p. 120)
- All front door paths being "good" says we're interested in the *total* rather than direct effect (*The Effect* p. 121)
- The set of variables to control for is called the adjustment set or identification strategy
- Including colliders is where we get *included variable bias*
- Instead of trying to close back doors, we can find ways of isolating just front doors (i.e., direct, indirect, and total effects) (*The Effect* p. 130)
- Experimental control cuts the associations that would create back door paths (*The Effect* p. 131)
- "[W]e're just replacing the difficulty of finding and closing all back doors for a treatment variable with the difficulty of finding and closing all back doors for something else" (*The Effect* p. 139)
