- Paths are alternate explanations, ignoring the arrows of causality (*The Effect* p. 116)
- "[E]ach of those paths contains a story" (*The Effect* p. 120)
- All front door paths being "good" says we're interested in the *total* rather than direct effect (*The Effect* p. 121)
- The set of variables to control for is called the adjustment set or identification strategy
- Including colliders is where we get *included variable bias*
