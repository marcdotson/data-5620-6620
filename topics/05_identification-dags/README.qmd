- Reference to DGPs in physical vs. social science (*The Effect* p. 68)
- Excellent description of the place for simulating data (*The Effect* p. 69)
- Using simulated data to demonstrate the need for an identification strategy via knowledge about the DGP (e.g., omitted variable bias) (*The Effect* p. 69)
- Identification as isolating the causal estimand (*The Effect* p. 77)
- "This observation has *identified* an answer to our question, simply by closing off every other possible explanation." (*The Effect* p. 77)
- This is the benefit of *random* experiments, where randomization closes off every other possible explanation for us -- the ones we know about and the ones we don't
- "We need to make a claim about what we *already know* in order to have any hopes of learning something new" (*The Effect* p. 78)
- Understanding (or assuming) a DGP is necessary to identify the causal estimand of interest, but it's also needed for parametric modeling generally
- Even for non-causal questions, there is often a causal question *lurking* underneath (*The Effect* p. 88)
- Causality is about *intervention*, it has *direction* and thus implies a temporal order, but it's about changing the probability of something occuring---its not deterministic (*The Effect* p. 89)
- We have both direct and indirect causal effects (*The Effect* p. 96, 98)
- All models are built on assumptions, and a DAG makes them explicit, particulary the identifying assumptions (*The Effect* p. 97)
- The causal estimand, the variable of interest, that's the treatment variable (note the language of experiments) (*The Effect* p. 102)
- Simplify the DGP/DAG by removing variables with tiny and unimportant effects, that are redundant/can be combined with other variables, mediators, or not relevant to identifying the causal effect (*The Effect* p. 107-108)
- Formal description of the arrow of time and the need for an acylcic graph (*The Effect* p. 110)
